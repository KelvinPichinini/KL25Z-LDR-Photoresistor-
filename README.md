# LDR-KL25Z

**ATENTION** in the schematics i changed the places of the resistors, please switch them so that the signal read is compatible with the code.


A simple circuit developed for a Freedom KL25Z board that consist of a photoresistor a couple of resistors and a LED.

What the circuit does?

  Based on how much light there is in the ambient it turn on or turn off the LED.
  
Required Materials:



- +- 7 jumpers
- 1 LED (can use the one inside the board)
- 1 Photoresistor
- 1 1k Resistor
- 1 330 ohms Resistor
- Freedom KL25Z board
- USB Cable
- A pc with some way to compile and deploy your code to the board
